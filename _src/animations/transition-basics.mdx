## Introduction

Within Litho, UI updates are performed by changing state or props on the Component Tree, instead of mutating the views directly.
The animation framework adds transitions to components that are triggered when regenerating a tree.

:::note
It's important to avoid accessing the underlying view to add animations as these values will probably not be preserved.
:::

Transitions can be used to animate view properties when they change between layouts, which is due to a state update or new props from the parent.
When changes to a tree occur due to a new state, these changes happen immediately.

The following code and animation show a simple Component that renders a yellow square then aligns it to either the right or left edge of screen based on value of the `@State boolean toRight`:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/docs/SimpleAllLayoutTransitionComponentSpec.java start=start end=no_animation
```

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/transitions/basics1.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

When the value of the state changes, the `ComponentTree` is re-rendered, which makes the square appear to 'jump' from its previous position to the new one.
The following section shows how to replace this 'jump' with a transition animation.

## Bounds Transitions

To add bounds animations to all transitioning components between tree changes, use the following:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/docs/SimpleAllLayoutTransitionComponentSpec.java start=no_animation end=end
```

Returning [`Transition.allLayout()`](https://staticdocs.thefacebook.com/litho/javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.html#allLayout--) creates a Transition that automatically animates any changes to position, width, or height, as shown in the following animation.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/transitions/basics2.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

This method only works when changing the bounds of a component.  It does not work with:

* **Other properties**, including scale, alpha, and rotation.
* **Components** being added or removed.

## Transitions

For greater control over the transitions, you can use the following APIs:

* **`@OnCreateTransition`** method - you need to add a method annotated with `@OnCreateTransition` to your Spec, which is used to define the transition animations. It should return a [Transition](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.html) where its first argument should always be of type `ComponentContext`. As with other lifecycle methods in a Spec, it could also have `@Prop` and  `StateValue`-type arguments.
* **`Transition`** - a description of the Component/Property (mandatory) and how (optional) you want to animate it. Instead of using a Constructor to create `Transition` instances, you'll use one of the provided `Builder`s.
* **`transitionKey`** - an identifier that you'd normally assign to a `Component` that you want to animate.  The key is then used when defining `Transition`.
* **`AnimatedProperties`** - used to target the property of a `Component` that should be animated when its value changes.

The following sample shows the APIs in use:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/docs/AlphaTransitionComponentSpec.java start=start end=end
```

In the above code:

* On *line 16*, a `transitionKey` is assigned to the component using the [Component.Builder#transitionKey](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Component.Builder.html#transitionKey-java.lang.String-) method.
2. In *lines 22-24*, a `Transition` is created using [Transition.create()](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.html#create-java.lang.String-) that takes a `transitionKey` and then specifies the property of the component using the [.animate()](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.TransitionUnitsBuilder.html#animate-com.facebook.litho.animation.AnimatedProperty-) method, which takes an [AnimatedProperty](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/animation/AnimatedProperties.html).

Both of these methods take a [variable number of arguments](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.html#create-java.lang.String...-), which means multiple `Transition`s may be expressed as follows:

```java
private static final String SQUARE_KEY = "square";
private static final String OVAL_KEY = "oval";
private static final String ANOTHER_SHAPE = "another_shape";

...

@OnCreateTransition
static Transition onCreateTransition(ComponentContext c) {
    return Transition.create(SQUARE_KEY, OVAL_KEY, ANOTHER_SHAPE)
        .animate(AnimatedProperties.X, AnimatedProperties.Y);
}
```

The following animation shows the AlphaTransitionComponentSpec in action.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/transitions/basics3.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

The transitions animations API supports three [types of transitions](transition-types.mdx): **Change**, **Appear** and **Disappear**, which work differently depending on how the tree changes between states. The example in this page uses a Change transition.
